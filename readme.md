#### The Hosts sources that are used in this Repository, have their own Licenses. The links of the HOSTS sources that are used in this repo (which includes their own licenses) can be found in my code: ["Download-and-Process-Hosts.sh"](https://github.com/j-moriarti/pDNSf-Hosts-collection/blob/master/Download-and-Process-Hosts.sh)
#### The compiled hosts in this Repo are meant for my personal usage only. I have no responsibility about others misusing of these files.

#### !!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! :wink:
 
 
#### This hosts file is specially optimized for ["PersonalDNSfilter"](https://www.zenz-solutions.de/personaldnsfilter/) app. This [Open-Source](https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter) app can handle any number of Domains without affecting on ram usage! So there would be no problems adding these hosts to it!
 

##### !!! THIS HOSTS FILE IS EXTREMELY LARGE !!!

##### !!! There is a high possibility of FALSE-POSITIVE or UNWANTED BLOCKING !!!

##### !!! Be prepared for manual whitelisting in pDNSf !!!

##### !!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED AGAIN!!!
